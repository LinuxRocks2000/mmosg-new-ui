                <p>
                    Welcome to the MMOSG Client Documentation! This page attempts to be a complete and completely informative resource on all aspects of MMOSG's protocol and core concepts.
                    This is <i>not</i> particularly useful for server developers; I shall have to write a separate documentation for them. Much of what you need can probably be inferred directly
                    from other client code, but MAKE SURE TO READ THE <a href="#guarantees-and-reqs">Guarantees and Requirements</a>! Players of your client will not appreciate being disconnected
                    because you didn't pay attention to them.
                </p>
                <h1 id="objects-and-banners">Objects and Banners</h1>
                <p>
                    One of the most important concepts in MMOSG is the banner system - it's the only way to tell who owns an object, or who is on what team. A banner is just a 32-bit unsigned integer - the index in
                    a list of strings. The string it indexes is the banner text. Banners are guaranteed to be unique under any logical circumstance - they are only cleared when every client has disconnected. They are
                    also guaranteed to be descriptive to the program itself - they are, for instance, how you determine teammates. Banners are absolute: nothing is left to chance with them, which is why there's no way
                    to hot-delete banner entries. This ensures that they will always be stable even under ridiculous server conditions and bizarre network errors. The banner 0 is reserved - it's usually "None",
                    but different parts of your program should handle it specifically. Such as, all chat messages from banner 0 should be treated as highest-priority and marked "SYSTEM" or "GOD" or similar.
                    You should keep a cache of all banners the server sends at all times regardless of the state of that banner; the only valid banner lifetime is until server reset (practically until the client disconnects).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In MMOSG, objects are defined by 7 properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>X: the <i>center</i> X position on the universe grid of the object</li>
                    <li>Y: the <i>center</i> Y position on the universe grid of the object</li>
                    <li>W: the width of the object</li>
                    <li>H: the height of the object</li>
                    <li>A: the angle of the object, rotated about X,Y</li>
                    <li>Type: a single byte representing what type the object is. See <a href="#types">Types</a>.</li>
                    <li>Banner: the banner (NOT the banner string!) owning the object.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>The Protocol</h1>
                <p>
                    The MMOSG protocol is in the most memory compact possible format.
